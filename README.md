Hi, I’m Miles! Hope your day is going well, welcome to my Github.

I am currently a graduate student completing a thesis baised MSc in Applied Mathamatics at the Univeristy of Alberta. 

I have a broad set of intrest that lie within the following topics...

A) Developing models, algorithms, and software based systems to advance discovery and solve problems in the sciences and industry

B) Supervised and reinforcement learning, both applied and theoretical 

C) High-performance and parallel computing for large-scale simulations and machine learning

I'm open to project colaborations, feel free to reach out.

You can reach me at my student email (mhkent@ualberta.ca), or by messaging me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-kent-673b3a27a/). 

Fun fact: I enjoy Weighlifting when I am not working or studying. I try to compete in two to three compititions a year.
